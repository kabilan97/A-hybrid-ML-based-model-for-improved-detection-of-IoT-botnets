# A-hybrid-ML-based-model-for-improved-detection-of-IoT-botnets

The code necessary to run the research of "A-hybrid-ML-based-model-for-improved-detection-of-IoT-botnets".

## Requirements

* Jupyter Notebook
* Python 3.7
* Libraries from the `requirements.txt` file
* N-BaIoT dataset downloaded from: <https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/442/detection+of+iot+botnet+attacks+n+baiot/>, put each of the nine devices data in the empty folders with the corresponding name

## Run

Start the Jupyter Notebook and open the file `Thesis_analysis.ypnb`. This contains all the code needed for the data read-in, data preprocessing, feature selection, hybrid model, and evaluation. 

## Additional components

* `/figures`: folder contains the Kernel density estimate plots for all devices
